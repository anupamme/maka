// Build the DeepSeek Harness toolchain that the Eval external subject mounts
// read-only at /opt/maka-deepseek-harness-toolchain.
//
// The harness's minimal composition pulls in two native modules — node-pty for
// the persistent shell, koffi for the filesystem and session backends — and
// node-pty publishes no Linux prebuild. The toolchain therefore cannot be
// installed on a macOS host and mounted into a linux/amd64 task container; it
// is built inside a matching container, which also supplies the pinned Node.
//
// The fingerprint is the digest of checksums.sha256, which lists every regular
// file this build put in the tree, itself and manifest.json aside. So the
// constant committed in src/toolchain-verification.ts pins the checksum
// manifest, and the manifest pins the content of every file it names. It does
// not pin the tree's closure: verification walks the manifest, not the
// directory, so a file added afterwards is neither named nor refused. That gap
// predates this arm and belongs to verifyToolchainDirectory. A fingerprint
// derived from the build inputs alone would match two different installs of
// the same version, which is exactly the drift a benchmark needs to detect.
//
// Native modules are compiled during the build and need not come out
// byte-identical on another machine, so rebuilding can produce a new
// fingerprint even from the same lockfile. That is the point: re-pin it with
// --write and the change is visible in review.
