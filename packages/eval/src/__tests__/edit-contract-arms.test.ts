// What makes the three DeepSeek Harness arms a controlled comparison rather
// than three arms that happen to resemble each other.
//
// Their compositions are three files, so nothing structural stops one of them
// from acquiring a second difference — a bumped timeout, a reasoning setting,
// an extra service, a narrowed context window — and a run would still produce
// numbers. The numbers would just no longer be about the edit contract. These
// assertions are the thing that fails first when that happens.
//
// The arm-to-directory table is imported rather than restated, so a test that
// passes is a statement about the compositions the subject actually copies.
//
// Two things this file does not cover, named so they are not mistaken for
// covered. The patch arm's own tool — its name, its parameter and its
// description — is asserted in
// harbor/deepseek-harness-toolchain/plugins/tool-apply-patch/__tests__, because
// that surface is JavaScript rather than a composition row. And the preparer
// that copies these profiles is an entrypoint module with side effects at
// import, so it is not imported here; the three arms share one function and
// differ only in the directory passed to it, and a failure of that sharing
// stops the harness from booting rather than biasing a score.

// The rows each arm is allowed to differ by: its editor, and nothing else. No
// arm mounts `fs-observation-policy` — it is not part of any edit contract, and

// Pinned whole rather than by id. Naming only the id would leave the treatment
// itself unguarded — the one thing the experiment measures — so an override of
// the patch tool's description, or a tenfold cut to an editor's output budget,
// would be the sole edit here that no assertion covers. Changing a contract is
