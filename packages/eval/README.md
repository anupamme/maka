# @maka/eval

`@maka/eval` owns experiment semantics. It does not execute Maka or construct Runtime objects.

       Runtime Host executes Maka subjects
```

An Experiment combines one benchmark, one executor, all subjects, all tasks, a repetition count, one shared budget, one verifier, and a frozen task-group concurrency limit. Cells are the Cartesian product `task × repetition × subject`. All subject arms in one task repetition start together; independent task groups run up to the declared limit. A repetition is a new experimental sample; an infrastructure retry appends a replacement attempt to the same cell; continuation remains internal to Runtime Host. Each subject declares only the credential environment names its cells receive.

Run a fully expanded spec through the public CLI:

```sh
maka eval run experiment.json --out .maka-eval/run-001
```

Use `--cell <cell-id>` to replace one failed or indeterminate cell. The attempt log is append-only and result selection always uses the earliest valid attempt.

The built-in Harbor and Pier executors use one relay Agent. The framework prepares the task environment, the relay invokes exactly one Eval subject from `Agent.run()`, and the framework runs its native verifier and finalizer. Harbor and Pier use separate, explicitly versioned Python environments because their Agent and task contracts differ.

Maka subjects ask the Runtime Host client to run one owned execution in a dedicated Host root. Session, Turn, Goal and continuation semantics remain inside Runtime Host. External subjects declare a command and arguments, and may add non-secret environment values, target-to-source bindings for declared credentials, and an explicit result contract. Omitted credential bindings use declared names unchanged. The generic `exit-code` contract discards unstructured stdout and records null usage and cost. The structured `protocol-v1` contract is restricted to the bundled external wrapper so the shared relay can separate a bounded result frame from Harbor/Pier's merged process output; cohort-specific wrappers do not gain Runtime authority.

The result kernel contains only score, normalized usage, attributable cost, duration, status, and artifacts. Specs carry every semantic setting; environment variables are reserved for credentials and machine-local paths.

The checked-in Terminal-Bench 2.1 four-arm cohort is `experiments/terminal-bench-2.1-deepseek-v4-flash-four-arm.json`. It freezes provider endpoints, framework version, container paths and read-only mount policy. Set each declared machine-path environment variable to its trusted prepared directory, and set the declared API-key credentials. Machine-local paths select artifacts; they do not alter experiment semantics and are not presented as a cryptographic identity scheme.

The single-arm DeepSeek Harness cohort is `experiments/terminal-bench-2.1-deepseek-v4-flash-deepseek-harness.json`. The harness ships no benchmark runner: its `BENCHMARK.md` names the checked-in `examples/jsonrpc-agent` minimal composition and asks for one workspace and session id per task. `harbor/deepseek-harness-profile/` is that composition, carried as a complete harness profile whose manifest declares no bundles. Because the tree is composed over an empty entry list, every entry the model can observe is named in one file, an upstream bundle gaining a plugin cannot widen this arm's tool surface, and a missing service is a boot failure rather than a silent downgrade. The composition was compared against upstream during development — tool names, tool schemas, system prompt and message sequence on the first outbound request — and found identical; that was a one-time manual check rather than a standing one, and nothing in this repository reproduces it. Three deviations are recorded in the file. Reasoning is pinned to max because the adapter default resolves to `reasoning_effort=high` on the wire; the Bash deadline is raised from upstream's five minutes because that one can interrupt package installation and leave the task environment unusable for verification; and `streamIdleTimeoutMs` is set to upstream's own 172800000, which these profiles had omitted, leaving the adapter's 300000 ms default — a five-minute ceiling on the gap between two streamed tokens — in force behind `reasoningEffort: max`.

Build that arm's toolchain with `node scripts/prepare-deepseek-harness-toolchain.mjs --out <dir> --write`, run from the repository root — unlike the other paths in this section, that one is not relative to `packages/eval`. It runs inside a pinned `linux/amd64` container because the composition depends on `node-pty`, which publishes no Linux prebuild, and it copies that container's Node into the toolchain so the executed path resolves inside the mounted root. Dependencies are installed with `npm ci` from the reviewed lockfile in `harbor/deepseek-harness-toolchain/`, so a harness version does not silently mean two different trees. The recorded fingerprint is the digest of `checksums.sha256`, which lists every regular file the build put in the tree apart from itself and `manifest.json`, and verification recomputes that digest from the manifest on disk rather than reading the value the tree reports for itself. The constant in `src/toolchain-verification.ts` therefore pins the manifest, and the manifest pins the content of every file it names. It does not pin the tree's closure: verification walks the manifest rather than the directory, so a file added to a mounted toolchain afterwards is neither named nor refused. That is the existing behaviour of `verifyToolchainDirectory` for all ten registered profiles and belongs to it. Native modules are compiled during the build and need not come out byte-identical on another machine, so a rebuild can still produce a new fingerprint; `--write` re-pins it and verification fails closed until the two agree. `--out` is rebuilt from scratch: it must name a directory, and one that is either empty or a previous build of this toolchain.

`experiments/terminal-bench-2.1-deepseek-v4-flash-maka-vs-deepseek-harness.json` runs Maka and the harness arm in one task group, so each task starts one container of each at the same moment rather than comparing two runs on two occasions. Two properties of that spec do not follow from the framework and belong to whoever reads its results.

Pairing is not preserved. Task groups are an execution unit: cells are grouped by `task × repetition` to schedule concurrency, but result selection is per cell, and a cell with no selectable attempt is dropped from the result map on its own. Losing one arm therefore leaves the other arm's observation in the data as an unmatched sample rather than removing the pair. Loss is also not random — an attempt is likelier to be lost the longer its container lives and the more requests it makes — so an unmatched observation is systematically biased toward the arm that finished sooner. Comparing the two arms means re-pairing by `task.id` and discarding unmatched observations, not averaging each arm's surviving cells.

Both arms meet the same policy: `egressProxy` is executor configuration, subjects cannot override it, and no subject in that spec declares one. What that proves is bounded in two ways. The URL policy is a blocklist for known contamination surfaces, so it addresses a subject that stumbles onto an answers page and not one deliberately looking for one; issues #2976 and #2977 describe channels that remain outside the audited path. And an equal policy is equal opportunity, not equal use — whether an arm reaches a residual channel depends on how that arm behaves, which is precisely this experiment's independent variable. Because those channels are by definition unaudited, a difference in use between the arms would not appear in the evidence either way.

Single-arm results are not drawn from the same run as the multi-arm cohort. Task groups hold every subject for one task, so each arm adds a container: the eight-arm cohort reaches 128 concurrent trials at its declared limit, and this spec raises its own limit so its 89 cells run under comparable machine load. They remain separate runs on separate occasions, which no setting can change.

`experiments/terminal-bench-2.1-deepseek-v4-flash-edit-contracts.json` isolates one variable across three arms: the contract through which the model edits files. `deepseek-harness` is the arm above, with the harness's `str_replace_editor` — one tool, four commands, a unique-literal match, all of its guidance in the tool description. `deepseek-harness-fs` swaps it for the harness's own `read`/`write`/`edit`, which are three tools with snake_case arguments that also register three system-prompt guidance sections of their own. `deepseek-harness-apply-patch` swaps it for a V4A `apply_patch` that takes one patch envelope and locates each change by surrounding context. Everything else is held: the same one-shot CLI, the same toolchain and fingerprint, the same `dsh-fs-local` provider underneath every editor, and byte-identical `package.json` and `cordis.yml`. The variable is the whole tool family and not one dimension of it — tool count, argument names, path conventions, and where the guidance lives move together, because each family ships that way. A result is therefore attributable to the family as shipped, not to patch syntax as such; the arm names say `edit contract` but the treatment is broader than the phrase suggests, and any write-up has to say so. No arm mounts `dsh-fs-observation-policy`. It was mounted for the `fs` arm alone on the reasoning that its tools' guidance mentions the policy, which does not survive checking how the harness ships: of the four presets in `@deepseek-ai/dsh`, three mount `dsh-tool-fs` and none mounts the policy, and the policy's own documentation covers `str_replace_editor` too. It is substrate rather than part of an editor, and mounting it in one arm gave that arm two failure modes — an edit without a prior read, and a file the model's own shell touched in between — that the others cannot have. Read budgets are matched by hand for the same reason: `readMaxBytes` is set to the baseline editor's `maxOutputChars` rather than left at a default 3.2 times larger. What that matches is the number, not the delivered content and not the context cost, because the two budgets measure different things. Both tools number their lines. The baseline truncates the fully rendered string, gutter and header included; the `fs` tool charges its budget against raw line bytes and adds the `NNN: ` gutter, the `<path>/<type>/<content>` envelope and the footer outside it. `scripts/measure-read-budget.mjs` reimplements both renderers from the shipped code and reports the residual, so the figure is reproducible rather than quoted: at 16000 over this repository's 2195 tracked TS/JS/Python sources the `fs` arm delivers 1.093 times the lines and emits 1.009 times the characters. Both tails, since only the flattering one was reported before: the most `fs`-favourable file is 1.332 times the lines and 1.186 times the characters, the least is 0.837 and 0.730, the latter because the unit is a mismatch too — UTF-16 code units against UTF-8 bytes — which coincide on ASCII and narrow the `fs` arm's window on text that is not. Equalising delivered content instead would mean choosing a budget from an assumed average line length, a larger free parameter than those few percent. `readMaxLineLength` is matched as well, to the same 16000. Left at its shipped 2000 it was a cap the baseline has no counterpart to: the `fs` arm could never see the 2001st character of any line at any offset, while the baseline can spend its whole budget on a single line, and a minified bundle or a one-line JSON payload is where that difference lands. What holds the comparison together is `src/__tests__/edit-contract-arms.test.ts`, which parses all three compositions and fails when they differ by any entry outside their editors, when they compose in a different order, when an editor row itself stops matching what the test declares, when a control drifts in one of them, when the arms stop sharing one toolchain identity object, or when the experiment launches them with anything but a different profile argument. It compares whole entries, `config` included: reading only each row's id and package left every setting inside it unchecked, which is how a narrowed context window or a halved output budget would have passed. It also refuses a composition step it cannot read — the patch format allows overriding an already-composed entry as well as inserting one, and a step of that kind was being skipped, so an override of the patch tool's own description would have gone unseen — reads each profile's file list from disk rather than naming the two files it expects, and compares the whole subject definition rather than the argument vector alone, so a subject pointed at a different API or run under a different node fails here.

The harness ships no patch tool, so `harbor/deepseek-harness-toolchain/plugins/tool-apply-patch/` is this repository's, composed exactly as the other two editors are. The model-facing text, the envelope parser and the hunk applier are all Codex's, ported to JavaScript rather than depended on: `@openai/codex` is a Rust binary, and the alternative — the OpenAI Agents SDK's `applyDiff`, which is the JavaScript V4A implementation that exists — turned out not to be Codex's algorithm at all. Sources and licences are recorded in `harbor/deepseek-harness-toolchain/plugins/NOTICE`.

One deviation from Codex cannot be removed, and it is the first thing a reader of these numbers needs. `apply_patch` in Codex is a **freeform tool**: the API is sent a 108-character description and a Lark grammar the decoder is constrained to, so a model on that path cannot emit a malformed envelope at all. The harness registers JSON function tools and has no grammar seam, so this arm is the unconstrained case. What it gives the model instead is upstream's own prose for exactly that case — the `## apply_patch` section of `prompt_with_apply_patch_instructions.md`, the base instructions Codex carried when the format had to be taught rather than enforced — carried as a verbatim file with three substitutions applied over it, each of which a test requires to apply exactly once. That file is upstream's and it is retired: at the ported commit it is referenced only from a test whose four model cases all declare `expects_apply_patch_description: false`, and none of the eight instruction templates in `models-manager/models.json` carries the section. So no shipped Codex configuration is the one this arm is in, and the choice was between upstream's own retired prose and prose written here. The arm therefore measures a V4A contract delivered as a function tool, not Codex's contract; syntax errors this arm can make are errors Codex's decoder would have prevented, and that is a cost charged to this arm and to no other. What is *not* a cost charged to it is the absence of a read tool. Codex registers none either — its handler set at the ported commit is shell, `exec_command`, `write_stdin`, `apply_patch`, `update_plan`, `view_image` and the MCP and plan tools, and files are read through the shell — so an arm that reads with `cat` is that contract rather than a handicap applied to it, and the bash every arm gets is the same bash.

Four further divergences are known and each is pinned to bytes the reference produces rather than to a judgement. The tool implements the function-tool path, which verifies a whole envelope and then re-applies it, where the standalone binary applies sequentially with no verification — so an envelope naming one path twice is refused here and composed there, and a section that fails after an earlier one succeeded leaves nothing here and partial state there. It runs `NormalizeToLf`, the shipped default; `PreserveLineEndings` is `Stage::UnderDevelopment, default_enabled: false` upstream. Its diagnostics differ from the reference's, which is the one place this arm may be easier on a model. And a leading byte-order mark is gone before the tool sees the file: the shared `dsh-fs-local` provider decodes with `new TextDecoder('utf-8', {fatal: true})`, whose `ignoreBOM` defaults to false, so a patch whose context omits the mark applies here and is refused there — a property of the harness rather than of this arm, since every arm reads through that provider. The first, second and fourth are named with their causes in `codex-fixtures.test.mjs` and `upstream-scenarios.test.mjs`; the diagnostics difference is recorded only here.

Because that tool is this repository's while the other two arms' are their vendor's, its fidelity to Codex is itself an experimental variable, and the ways it can be unfaithful are not symmetric: a tool stricter than the reference costs its arm turns the reference never spends, and a tool safer than the reference wins its arm recoveries the reference never gets. So fidelity is not argued from the Rust, it is measured against the binary. `plugins/tool-apply-patch/__tests__/codex-oracle.mjs` runs the released `codex` over a temporary tree for each of its 82 cases and records what it printed and what the tree became; `codex-fixtures.test.mjs` replays every case through the registered tool and compares, and needs no `codex` to do it. Those cases are still inputs this repository chose, which is why `__tests__/upstream/scenarios/` carries Codex's own conformance suite verbatim — 25 scenario directories upstream publishes as "meant to be easily portable to other languages or platforms" — and `upstream-scenarios.test.mjs` replays them the way upstream does: copy the input tree, apply the patch, ignore the exit status, require the resulting tree to match exactly. 22 match outright and the three that do not are the divergences named above. It is the only check here whose inputs this repository did not choose. `codex-fuzz.mjs` covers what nobody thought to write down, generating envelopes from random line soup and running both; 2300 of them, across four seeds, currently diverge on nothing, and it catches the port's three sharpest edges — the insertion point of a context-free hunk, the trailing newline, and the punctuation-folding match pass — when each is deliberately removed. That check is what condemned the vendored `applyDiff`, which had looked correct through two rounds of reading: it placed a context-free `+` hunk at the `@@` anchor where Codex places it at end of file, left an updated file without the trailing newline Codex adds, kept CRLF where Codex normalises it, and refused near-miss context that Codex's four matching passes accept. Divergences found earlier and also removed: `*** Add File:` did not terminate the created file with a newline; `*** Add File:` over an existing file was refused, where Codex records what it overwrote and writes; a bare `*** Move to:` with no hunks was accepted, where Codex rejects an update with an empty chunk list before it looks at the rename; leading whitespace and a leading newline were refused, both of which the reference accepts.

The grammar is implemented in full, `*** Delete File:` and `*** Move to:` included. Those two are the only operations `ctx.fs` has no primitive for — its mutating surface is `writeText` and `editText`, with no delete and no rename among the twelve methods `dsh-fs` declares — so they run against `ctx.fs.processPath(target)`, which is the provider's own answer to where a file is for something outside it to open. Refusing them instead would have measured something other than Codex's contract: a model trained on the real one would spend turns discovering that a third of the grammar is missing. The narrow exception is a provider that confines, where `processPath` would be the way around the sandbox; both operations then refuse up front. This arm mounts `dsh-sandbox-local` at `danger-full-access`, where nothing is confined and the model's own bash can already remove any file, so the refusal never fires. Work is split into two passes, which is the shape of Codex's own tool call and not an improvement on it. `try_verify_apply_patch_args` builds a map keyed by resolved path, rejects a duplicate key, and computes every hunk against the pre-patch snapshot, so an envelope naming one path twice is refused and a hunk the model guessed at costs nothing. The second pass then throws that result away: `ApplyPatchRuntime::run` hands the raw patch text back to `apply_patch_with_mode`, which re-parses it and applies it sequentially against the live filesystem, so a section reads what the sections before it left behind. An earlier version of this tool wrote the verified plan instead, which is a different contract rather than a cheaper one — under it a rename onto a path a later section also updates produced a file Codex would never produce, and `*** Move to:` naming its own source was refused where Codex writes the destination, unlinks the source, and reports success on a file that is now gone. A patch interrupted mid-write can still be partial, as it can under Codex, and the tool claims otherwise to no one.

External provider metering does not depend on the subject exiting cleanly. The wrapper's proxy writes
`agent/<profile>.provider-usage.json` at the start of every request, at its settlement, and at the
moment the provider states admission, renaming it into place so a reader sees one whole snapshot or
the previous one. Admission is recorded when it is observed rather than when the request finishes,
because the model work has been done and billed whether or not this process survives to see the
stream end. When the result frame is missing — the wrapper was killed rather than asked to stop —
the executor recovers usage from that file. A run that was cut off after admitted model work is
therefore scored as a failed subject rather than retried as infrastructure.

That last rule reads the evidence, not the symptom, so it applies where the evidence supports it and
not elsewhere. A subject whose execution returned — the relay observed it exit, and only its result
frame is missing — did stop on its own terms, so admitted model work makes that a recorded failure
rather than a cell to run again at the same cost. A subject whose execution call *threw* is a
different claim: the relay, the executor or the host process failed, and it may never have started.
There, admitted work is still recorded and attributed, but it does not turn an infrastructure
failure into a zero.

The checkpoint carries only what the proxy observed: usage, whether the proxy had settled, and the
request, in-flight, admitted, and usage-request counts. Settlement is there because no arrangement of
the counts implies it — a checkpoint written between two requests has nothing in flight either — and
a stale file that claimed to be complete would report a fraction of a run's cost as a settled figure.
Whether the figure is complete, how many admitted requests are missing usage, and what the run cost
are worked out from those raw facts by one function both sides call, so the two processes cannot hold
two versions of a value neither of them owns. Cost is reported only for a
complete figure; a partial token count is kept as a lower bound, because a cost derived from it would
enter the result kernel indistinguishable from a settled one.

The wrapper's process exit code projects its semantic status: zero only when the subject completed.
The executor prefers the result frame wherever the frame is readable, and falls back to the exit code
only for a frame that carries no status of its own. Nothing else decides anything from it, but the
two must not be able to say different things.

A subject that exhausts the framework timeout is reported as `subject_failed` with its verifier reward intact. The reward is the outcome; the status records that the run was cut off rather than finishing on its own. Only a missing reward is an infrastructure failure.

Maka benchmark subjects freeze a versioned Session profile. `headless-coding-v1` is persisted in
the Session header, so later turns and backend rebuilds retain the same contract. It fixes the
system prompt, disables product identity/personalization/skills/workspace-memory prompt fragments,
admits only `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, and `apply_patch` as tool candidates,
and exposes a foreground-only Bash schema without `run_in_background` or `pty`. Provider-specific
routing remains authoritative: DeepSeek Responses exposes `apply_patch` instead of `Write` and
`Edit`, and Runtime-owned `ArchiveRead` remains available for archived tool results. A real
`hosted.execution.start` regression test pins SHA-256 hashes for the first main provider request's
developer prompt and complete tool schema.

Every benchmark subject removes `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, and `FetchURL` from the provider-visible
tool list. Maka enforces that through its Hosted Execution profile; external harnesses pass through
the Eval metering proxy, which structurally removes named and provider-native web tools from JSON
requests. Shell networking remains enabled. The configured HTTPS egress proxy blocks only
benchmark and public-solution contamination URLs, including normalized or recursively wrapped
`terminal-bench` references, pinned benchmark revisions, task registries, benchmark repositories,
public trajectories, and known patch mirrors. The general `terminal-bench` match searches the host
and the path separately, so a contamination surface named only in the hostname is blocked too, and
no rule can match across the boundary between the two fields. Only Harbor applies
the namespace policy, so a pier executor spec that declares `egressProxy` is rejected when it is
decoded rather than running with the proxy set up and enforcement absent. The checked-in Compose
overlay gives every cell its own MITM proxy, CA, bounded audit log, and health gate. The proxy keeps its confdir and audit log
private and publishes only `mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem` into the certificate-only volume the subject
mounts read-only, so the CA private key and the audit log never enter the subject namespace. During
`Agent.run()`, Harbor's Docker egress sidecar applies an nftables allowlist containing only that
proxy service; direct subject egress is therefore rejected even when a command unsets proxy
variables or requests `--noproxy`. The namespace policy accepts TCP to that proxy and traffic to
namespace-local addresses, and rejects everything else, ICMP included. Rejecting rather than
redirecting the remainder also closes a connection the subject inherits from an earlier phase: the
redirect is a NAT rule, and NAT is evaluated only on a connection's first packet. The
namespace-local exemption keeps the loopback provider proxies reachable and, with them, Docker's
embedded resolver at `127.0.0.11`, which forwards names it does not own to the host's upstream
resolvers. That is an unaudited channel out of the cell and back, tracked in issue #2976; until it is
closed the audited proxy is the only path for everything except DNS. The policy exempts no
packet mark: the
sidecar shares the subject's network namespace, so a mark the sidecar can set is one the subject can
set too, and gost forwards nothing in this mode anyway. Because that shared namespace also means the
policy only constrains what the IP output hooks can see, the overlay drops `NET_RAW`, which would
otherwise grant an `AF_PACKET` socket that writes beneath them; a task's own Compose can add that
capability back, and a `cap_add` wins over an overlay's `cap_drop`, so once the policy is live the
relay reads every capability set the subject could raise or reacquire one from, the bounding set
included, and refuses to start the subject when any of them carries `NET_RAW` or `NET_ADMIN`. Both
the drop and the gate cover the subject alone, not the namespace: a sibling service a task declares
joins the same namespace with the default capability set, so a task that declares one is less
isolated than a task that does not. The
same gate refuses when the subject is not in the namespace the policy was applied to: Harbor applies
the policy inside the sidecar but respects a task's own networking on the subject service, so a task
that declares it would otherwise leave the subject unpoliced. The evidence is the namespace identity
itself: the gate reads `/proc/self/ns/net` in the subject and in the service Harbor installs the
policy in, and requires the two to name one namespace. The gate reads that
evidence through the task image's own userland, so it establishes that a task did not lose the
isolation by accident, not that a task could not lie about it; a task image that lies already
controls everything else in the cell. What it does hold against is the subject, which starts only
after the gate has passed. Harbor task
download and verifier phases retain their native network policy. Build the pinned
`maka-eval-egress-proxy:12.2.3` image from `harbor/egress-proxy/Dockerfile` before running the
cohort. `MAKA_EVAL_EGRESS_NAMESPACE_TEST=1 python3 harbor/test_cell_egress_namespace.py` brings up
the overlay and the checked-in policy and asserts that contract in a real cell namespace; it needs
a Docker daemon and outbound network, and skips otherwise. This URL policy is a blocklist for known
benchmark and public-solution contamination surfaces, not a complete defense against a deliberately
invented lookup channel. It classifies what it can read: a `CONNECT` tunnel carrying something other
than TLS or HTTP reaches no rule and no audit record, which is tracked in issue #2977. Collected Maka runtime files
and egress audit logs are represented in attempt artifacts with byte counts and SHA-256 digests.

What the verifier scores is the environment the task was left in, so a subject that exits on its own
keeps whatever it started, whatever it reported. The relay does not tear the subject's process group
down at that point: nothing is waiting on those processes — the execution call has already returned —
so the teardown would not unblock anything, and it would edit the thing about to be measured for the
subjects Eval classifies as failed and not for the others. Cancellation and framework timeout still
quiesce, because there the subject has not stopped and the trial is being abandoned rather than
scored. The same rule binds the agent frameworks: the DeepSeek Harness owns a persistent PTY tree and
kills every descendant on shutdown, so the Eval-patched DSH subprocess skips that kill under
`DSH_PRESERVE_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES`, which Eval always sets.

A process group is not a reliable handle on a subject's processes in any case. `forkpty` makes the
shell a session leader, and an interactive shell puts each background job in a group of its own, so a
service started through a PTY is two removes from the group the relay records — measured, not
assumed. Any rule that depended on signalling that group would hold for some agent frameworks and
silently not for others.

The DeepSeek Harness Eval profile also extends its persistent Bash deadline beyond Terminal-Bench's
longest native subject timeout, so the benchmark remains the authoritative deadline and a local
five-minute tool timeout cannot interrupt `apt` or `dpkg` before verification. Every subject runs
with `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` and `TZ=Etc/UTC` in its execution environment, because an
interactive package prompt in an unattended container is indistinguishable from a hung command, and
that is a property of the container rather than of any one arm.

The local image tag remains a machine deployment identity rather than a registry digest; digest
pinning is tracked in issue #2953.

The experiment directory contains the frozen `experiment.json` and append-only attempt records. There is no second mutable results file. A leftover `.writer.lock` means the previous writer did not complete; remove it only after proving that no writer process remains.
