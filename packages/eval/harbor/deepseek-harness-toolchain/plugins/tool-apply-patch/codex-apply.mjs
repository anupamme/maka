// Applying one file's update chunks, ported from Codex.
//
// This replaces a vendored copy of the OpenAI Agents SDK's `applyDiff`, which
// was used here on the assumption that one V4A implementation is like another.
// It is not: the SDK wrote its own, and the two disagree on where a
// context-free `+` hunk lands, whether an updated file gains a trailing
// newline, how CRLF is treated, and how far a near-miss context line may drift
// before it is rejected. An arm that exists to measure Codex's contract cannot
// be running someone else's implementation of it, so this is a direct port of
// the reference rather than an equivalent-looking rewrite.

// Only the `NormalizeToLf` update mode is ported, which is what a shipped Codex
// uses. It is the `#[default]` for `ApplyPatchFileUpdateMode`; the function tool
// selects `PreserveLineEndings` from `Feature::ApplyPatchPreserveLineEndings`,
// which the feature registry declares `Stage::UnderDevelopment,
// default_enabled: false`, and the standalone binary selects it from an
// environment variable. That mode is the reason the upstream functions carry
// `context_line_indices`; nothing here needs it, so chunks do not record it.
// Upstream's two line-ending scenarios are run under it and are named as
// divergences in __tests__/upstream-scenarios.test.mjs.
