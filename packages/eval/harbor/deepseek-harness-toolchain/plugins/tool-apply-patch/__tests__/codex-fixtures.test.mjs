// Every fixture in codex-fixtures.json, replayed through this tool.
//
// The expectations were produced by running the `codex` binary itself over the
// same tree (see codex-oracle.mjs), so this asserts against the reference
// rather than against a reading of it. That distinction is the reason the file
// exists: the previous version of this tool applied hunks with a different
// project's V4A implementation, which reads correct and diverges on where a
// context-free `+` hunk lands, on trailing newlines, on CRLF, and on how far a
// near-miss context line may drift.
//
// Two cases are expected to diverge, both for the same reason. The fixtures
// come from the standalone `apply_patch` binary, which composes an envelope's
// operations one at a time; the function tool a model actually calls verifies
// the whole envelope first (`try_verify_apply_patch_args`, invocation.rs:214)
// and so refuses a duplicate path and writes nothing when any section fails.
// This tool implements the function tool. Both are named below with what they
// do instead.
